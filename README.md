# Secret Santa
This is a hacky solution for sending Secret Santa recipients to my family each Christmas. It's not a Secret Santa if anyone knows who has who so... hacky Node solution it is.

## Setup
* Run `cp config.example.json config.json` and fill in with your Twilio creds
* Run `cp people.example.json people.json` and fill in with your Santas/Recipients
* Run `npm start` to send!
